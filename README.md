# Main Target : **TN <-> NTN Relay strategy**
------
## NTN device carrier : Satellites
- satellites scenario
- base station deployment, UE scheduling, UE distributions
- beam, coverage, projection
- antenna, frequency, band
- orbit propogator, TLE, routings
- uplink, downlink channel model
- links:
  - ground-station satellite link, GSL
  - UE satellite link, USL
  - Inter Satellite Link, ISL
  - Inter Orbit Link, IOL
- link budget
- CNR
- Doppler model, compensation
- NB-IoT support
------
## experimental results
- energy-saving
- power consumption
- resource utilization / Throughput
- signal strength
- Trade-off : network latency and average satellite transmission power
- Trade-off : between power consumption and NTN coverage
