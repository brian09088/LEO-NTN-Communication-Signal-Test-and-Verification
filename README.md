# LEO-NTN : satellites simulation
- satellites scenario
- frequency, band, beam, coverage, projection
- antenna
- orbit propogator, TLE
- ISL, uplink, downlink, relay
- NB-IoT support
------
# experimental results
- energy-saving
- power consumption
- resource utilization
- signal strength
- Trade-off : network latency and average satellite transmission power
- Trade-off : between power consumption and NTN coverage
