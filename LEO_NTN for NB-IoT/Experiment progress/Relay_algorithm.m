%% Main script
% Define relay candidates and criteria

% Define relay candidates (e.g., LEO satellites, base stations)
% relay_candidates =
% Define criteria for relay selection (e.g., signal strength, link quality)
% criteria = 

% Relay Selection
selected_relay = relaySelection(relay_candidates, criteria);

% Handover
if performHandover(current_relay, selected_relay)
    % Perform handover to the selected relay
else
    % Stay connected to the current relay
end

%% MATLAB function code for Relay Algorithm Implementation
function [selected_relay] = relaySelection(relay_candidates, criteria)
    % Implement relay selection algorithm based on specified criteria
    % Example: select the relay with the strongest signal strength
    [~, idx] = max(criteria.signal_strength);
    selected_relay = relay_candidates(idx);
end

function [handover_decision] = performHandover(current_relay, next_relay)
    % Implement handover decision logic
    % Example: perform handover if the next relay provides better signal quality
    if next_relay.signal_quality > current_relay.signal_quality
        handover_decision = true;
    else
        handover_decision = false;
    end
